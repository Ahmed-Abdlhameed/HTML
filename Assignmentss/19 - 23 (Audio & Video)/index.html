                    Stop wasting your practice time on random violin lessons.
                    Learning violin is a lot easier when you have a step-by-step system to follow.
                    Julia's Violin Academy's Learning System is interconnected and organized to get slightly harder as you progress.
                    You watch a video lesson, play along, and then click a “Next” button to go to the next lesson.
                    Lessons have multiple camera angles, sheet music, different speeds and everything else you need to learn.
