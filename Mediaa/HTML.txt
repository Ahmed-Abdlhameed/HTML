                -> "Note 3": We can put the <tfoot> element directly after <table> element and it'll still be in his place because of 
                the right building of table components (<thead>, <tbody>) and that's the use of the <thead> & <tbody> & <tfoot>
                elements and so we can remove them all and just leave the <tr> & <td> elements but now you must put them under each
                other or what you put first will come first and what you put last will come last and so on.

                -> "Note 4": If you want to to merge two column (عمود) cells "and it usaually used in the <tfoot> part" then we type:
                <td colspan="2">Name of merged cell</td> and we remove the whole line of the deleted cell which is the next <td>
                in the same <tr> and the script will be:
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2">Name of merged cells</td>
                    <td>Value of merged cells</td>
                </tr>
                and if we want to type only one cell taking the 3 cells space we type:
                <td colspan="3">Name of merged cell</td>
                and so on you can do this with no matter how many cells.

                 -> "Note 5": If you want to to merge two row (صف) cells then we type:
                <td rowspan="2">Name of merged cells</td> and we remove the whole line of the deleted cell which is the same <td> in
                the next <tr> 
                and the script will be:
                <tr>
                    <td rowspan="2">Name of merged cell</td>
                    <td>Value 1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Value 2</td>
                    <td>Value 3</td>
                and if we want to type only one cell taking the 3 cells space we type:
                <td colspan="3">Name of merged cell</td>
                and so on you can do this with no matter how many cells.
                , notice that the second row is just a complete to the first one.
